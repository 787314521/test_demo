class=\"content\">通常情况下，当事人是不具有专业的法律素养以及出庭应诉的辩论能力和思维能力的，没有委托诉讼代理人，独自应对诉讼程序，只会导致其败诉的可能性增大。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">由于你自身缺乏相应的法律知识，以及对庭审程序不了解，单独出庭会增加自身的诉讼风险。</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n      >你和诉讼代理人都不按时出庭或者中途退庭，或经传票传唤，无正当理由拒不到庭，或者未经法庭许可中途退庭的，人民法院将按自动撤回起诉处理；被告反诉的，人民法院将对反诉的内容缺席审判，这不利于当事人诉求的实现。</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n      >你不出庭可能会增加你的诉讼风险。诉讼代理人无法真正代替当事人的位置，当事人本人没有出庭，有些事实很难查清，会拖长审理期限。当事人本人不出庭的情况下，当事人的知情权受到影响，会弱化当事人对诉讼代理人的监督。如果委托代理人与当事人本人就案件事实向法庭所作陈述不一致的，以当事人本人的陈述为准。如没有特殊情况，建议你和委托代理人一起出庭。</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n      >原始证据的证明力大于传来证据，直接证据的证明力大于间接证据的证明力。物证、书证、视听资料等证据的证明力要大于证人证言和当事人陈述，因为证人证言的主观性较强，容易携带当事人个人情感色彩，其证据可用性不高，因此当事人在提交证据时，要尽可能提交最能维护自身权益的客观证据材料。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">如果没有财产保全措施，对方有恶意转移财产、逃避债务等行为，可能导致胜诉后无财产可执行。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"title_min\">二、时间方面</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n

>二审判决的审理期限是自二审立案之日起三个月内审结，特殊情况需要延长的报本院院长批准。二审裁定的审理期限是自二审立案之日起30日内审结，特殊情况需要延长的，须报本院院长批准。因诉讼程序的进行会花费当事人相当一部分时间。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">按哪个程序审理，就按哪个程序的审限，推迟了当事人诉求实现的时间。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">因你不能提供被告的具体地址、电话等联系方式，如果找不到被告，可能至少需要公告送达两次，每次公告期限一般为60日。公告期限计入审判期限。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">需要鉴定评估或现场勘验可能需要一定的费用。鉴定评估和现场勘验需要花费一定时间</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">如果调解不成功，仍然走诉讼途径，那么立案、举证开庭、宣判等环节均需要您参加，需要付出一定的时间成本，可能还会造成一定的经济损失。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"title_min\">三、经济方面</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">一旦进入诉讼程序，当事人就会产生诉讼费用。</p>\r\n      <p

>通过非诉纠纷解决途径（比如调解）进行纠纷解决，能让当事人今后能够有一个更和谐的工作、生活、学习环境。诉讼难免影响感情，如果一纸判决下来，败诉方气没消，不主动履行应该履行的赔偿义务，法院再强制执行，恐怕当事人之间一生都会生分，弄不好还会激化矛盾。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"title_min\">五、信誉方面</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n      >如果当事人存在虚假诉讼、恶意诉讼等违反法律法规、违背道德准则的行为，比如恶意串通，以诉讼损害第三人的权利的，不仅会对自身信誉造成损害，还有相应的处罚的风险。</p>\r\n      <el-row>\r\n        <el-button @click=\"v_click\"

class=\"content\">通常情况下，当事人是不具有专业的法律素养以及出庭应诉的辩论能力和思维能力的，没有委托诉讼代理人，独自应对诉讼程序，只会导致其败诉的可能性增大。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">由于你自身缺乏相应的法律知识，以及对庭审程序不了解，单独出庭会增加自身的诉讼风险。</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n      >你和诉讼代理人都不按时出庭或者中途退庭，或经传票传唤，无正当理由拒不到庭，或者未经法庭许可中途退庭的，人民法院将按自动撤回起诉处理；被告反诉的，人民法院将对反诉的内容缺席审判，这不利于当事人诉求的实现。</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n      >你不出庭可能会增加你的诉讼风险。诉讼代理人无法真正代替当事人的位置，当事人本人没有出庭，有些事实很难查清，会拖长审理期限。当事人本人不出庭的情况下，当事人的知情权受到影响，会弱化当事人对诉讼代理人的监督。如果委托代理人与当事人本人就案件事实向法庭所作陈述不一致的，以当事人本人的陈述为准。如没有特殊情况，建议你和委托代理人一起出庭。</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n      >原始证据的证明力大于传来证据，直接证据的证明力大于间接证据的证明力。物证、书证、视听资料等证据的证明力要大于证人证言和当事人陈述，因为证人证言的主观性较强，容易携带当事人个人情感色彩，其证据可用性不高，因此当事人在提交证据时，要尽可能提交最能维护自身权益的客观证据材料。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">当事人由于人身损害诉讼的需要，申请鉴定的，需要由鉴定人出庭出庭作证，否则单独的鉴定意见也不能作为定案依据。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">不申请鉴定，可能造成人身伤害案件的相关事实得不到有效的验证。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">当事人提出人身损害赔偿诉讼的目的只是为了获取相关不当利益，其诉求将得不到人民法院的认可，法院将对超出正常诉讼请求范围的诉求不予准许。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">如果没有财产保全措施，对方有恶意转移财产、逃避债务等行为，可能导致胜诉后无财产可执行。</p>\r\n      <p

>二审判决的审理期限是自二审立案之日起三个月内审结，特殊情况需要延长的报本院院长批准。二审裁定的审理期限是自二审立案之日起30日内审结，特殊情况需要延长的，须报本院院长批准。因诉讼程序的进行会花费当事人相当一部分时间。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">按哪个程序审理，就按哪个程序的审限，推迟了当事人诉求实现的时间。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">因你不能提供被告的具体地址、电话等联系方式，如果找不到被告，可能至少需要公告送达两次，每次公告期限一般为60日。公告期限计入审判期限。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">如果调解不成功，仍然走诉讼途径，那么立案、举证开庭、宣判等环节均需要您参加，需要付出一定的时间成本，可能还会造成一定的经济损失。</p>\r\n      <p

<p class=\"content\">诉讼程序的启动会对其之后的合作关系造成影响，可能导致合作无法继续。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">通过非诉纠纷解决途径（比如调解）进行纠纷解决，能让当事人今后能够有一个更和谐的工作、生活、学习环境。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">诉讼难免影响感情，如果一纸判决下来，败诉方气没消，不主动履行应该履行的赔偿义务，法院再强制执行，恐怕当事人之间一生都会生分，弄不好还会激化矛盾。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"title_min\">五、信誉方面</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n

当事人起诉不符合法律规定条件的，人民法院不会受理，即使受理也会驳回起诉。\r\n        当事人起诉不符合管辖规定的，案件将会被移送到有权管辖的人民法院审理。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">\r\n        二、诉讼请求不适当\r\n        当事人提出的诉讼请求应明确、具体、完整，对未提出的诉讼请求人民法院不会审理。\r\n        当事人提出的诉讼请求要适当，不要随意扩大诉讼请求范围；无根据的诉讼请求，除得不到人民法院支持外，当事人还要负担相应的诉讼费用。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">\r\n        三、逾期改变诉讼请求\r\n        当事人增加、变更诉讼请求或者提出反诉，超过人民法院许可或者指定期限的，可能不被审理。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">\r\n        四、超过诉讼时效\r\n        当事人请求人民法院保护民事权利的期间一般为二年（特殊的为一年）。原告向人民法院起诉后，被告提出原告的起诉已超过法律保护期间的，如果原告没有对超过法律保护期间的事实提供证据证明，其诉讼请求不会得到人民法院的支持。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">\r\n        五、授权不明\r\n        当事人委托诉讼代理人代为承认、放弃、变更诉讼请求，进行和解，提起反诉或者上诉等事项的，应在授权委托书中特别注明。没有在授权委托书中明确、具体记明特别授权事项的，诉讼代理人就上述特别授权事项发表的意见不具有法律效力。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">\r\n        六、不按时交纳诉讼费用\r\n

当事人申请财产保全，应当按规定交纳保全费用而没有交纳的，人民法院不会对申请保全的财产采取保全措施。\r\n        当事人提出财产保全申请，未按人民法院要求提供相应财产担保的，人民法院将依法驳回其申请。\r\n        申请人申请财产保全有错误的，将要赔偿被申请人因财产保全所受到的损失。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">\r\n

除属于法律和司法解释规定的证人确有困难不能出庭的特殊情况外，当事人提供的证人证言，证人应当出庭作证并接受质询。如果证人不出庭作证，可能影响该证人证言的证据效力，甚至不被采信。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">\r\n        十二、不按规定申请审计、评估、鉴定\r\n        当事人申请审计、评估、鉴定，未在人民法院指定期限内提出申请或者不预交审计、评估、鉴定费用，或者不提供相关材料，致使争议的事实无法通过审计、评估、鉴定结论予以认定的，可能对申请人产生不利的裁判后果。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">\r\n        十三、不按时出庭或者中途退出法庭\r\n        原告经传票传唤，无正当理由拒不到庭，或者未经法庭许可中途退出法庭的，人民法院经按自动撤回起诉处理；被告反诉的，人民法院将对反诉的内容缺席审判。\r\n        被告经传票传唤，无正当理由拒不到庭，或者未经法庭许可中途退出法庭的，人民法院将缺席判决。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">\r\n        十四、不准确提供送达地址\r\n        适用简易程序审理的案件，人民法院按照当事人自己提供的送达地址送达诉讼文书时，因当事人提供的已方送达地址不准确，或者送达地址变更未及时告知人民法院，致使人民法院无法送达，造成诉讼文书被退回的，诉讼文书也视为送达。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">\r\n        十五、超过期限申请强制执行\r\n        向人民法院申请强制执行的期限为二年。期限自生效法律文书确定的履行义务期限届满之日起算；法律文书未规定履行期间的，从法律文书生效之日起算。超过上述期限申请的，除存在申请执行时效中止、中断等法定情形外，人民法院不予受理。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">\r\n        十六、无财产或者无足够财产可供执行\r\n        被执行人没有财产或者没有足够财产履行生效法律文书确定义务的，人民法院可能对未履行的部分裁定中止执行，申请执行人的财产权益将可能暂时无法实现或者不能完全实现。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">\r\n        十七、不履行生效法律文书确定义务\r\n        被执行人未按生效法律文书指定期间给付金钱义务的，将要支付迟延履行期间的双倍债务利息。\r\n        被执行人未按生效法律文书指定期间履行其他义务的，将要支付迟延履行金。\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n      >第一，执行前和解协议的履行期应控制在法定申请执行期限之内。《民事诉讼法》第二百一十九条规定：“申请执行的期限，双方或者一方当事人是公民的为一年，双方是法人或者其他组织的为六个月。”这样，万一债务人不按照执行前和解协议履行义务，债权人可以在法定的期限内向法院申请执行，从而有效避免了丧失请求法院强制执行以保护自身合法权益的权利。</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n      >第二，执行前和解协议应采用书面形式订立。最高人民法院1997年4月16日《关于超过诉讼时效期间当事人达成的和解协议是否应当受法律保护问题的批复》中规定：“超过诉讼时效期间，当事人双方就原债务达成的和解协议，属于新的债权、债务关系。”显然，该司法解释认为就原债务达成的和解协议已经不再是原来的债务法律关系，因此不属于一案再审的情况。如此，债权人只要注意在和解协议中建立新的债的关系，即使原生效的法律判决的债权超过申请执行的期限，也能以新的债务关系向法院提起诉讼，主张权利。</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n      >第三，坚持以在法院执行庭主持下的和解为主渠道。执行前自行和解虽然有一些好处，但弄不好就引起麻烦，还是以在法院执行庭主持下进行的执行和解为主较妥。《民事诉讼法》第二百一十一条规定：“在执行中，双方当事人自行和解达成协议的，执行人员应将协议内容记入笔录，由双方当事人签名或者盖章。一方当事人不履行和解协议的，人民法院可以根据对方当事人的申请，恢复对原生效法律文书的执行。”由此可见，执行和解是在执行过程中，当事人双方以终结执行程序为目的，通过协商，自愿就法律文书确定的权利义务达成协议的一种制度。由于执行和解是当事人在法律规定的范围内处分自己民事实体权利和申请法院强制执行权利的一种正当行为，因此对双方当事人均产生法律上的约束力，双方必须全面履行协议义务，一方不履行的，对方有权申请法院强制执行或者行使撤销权。这就为保障胜诉方的权利提供了有利的条件，从而也较好地规避了胜诉方的风险，保障了债权的安全度。</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n      >(1)超过申诉期限：申诉期限是指，申诉人应当自劳动争议发生之日起60日内向仲裁委提出书面申请，此60日为申诉期限。无正当理由逾期提出申请的为超过仲裁申诉期限。超过申诉期限申请劳动仲裁，又不能证明有中止、中断、延长事由的，除对方当事人认可外，将承担丧失胜诉权的风险。</p>\r\n      <p

 class=\"content\"\r\n      >(6)逾期或不提供鉴定材料:对需要鉴定的事项负有举证责任的当事人，在仲裁委指定的期限内无正当理由，不提出鉴定申请或不预交鉴定费用或拒不提供相关材料，致使对案件争议的事实无法通过坚定论予以认定的，应当对该事实承担举证不能的法律后果。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">(7)拒不提供证据:有证据证明一方当事人持有证据无正当理由拒不提供，如果对方当事人主张该证据的内容不利于证据持有人，可以推定该主张成立。</p>\r\n      <p class=\"content\">(8)证人未出庭作证:当事人提供证人证言的，除法律、司法解释规定的特殊情况外，证人应当亲自到庭作证接受询问，否则将承担证人证明力弱的风险。</p>\r\n

   <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n      >(10)当事人未实际收到仲裁文书:因当事人自己提供的送达地址不准确、送达地址变更未及时告知仲裁委，或者当事人拒不提供自己的送达地址而导致仲裁文书未能被当事人实际接收的，仲裁委将按下列方式处理： A.邮寄送达的，以邮件回执上注明的退回之日视为送达之日;

class=\"content\">(12)拒收、拒签收仲裁文书:当事人拒收、拒签仲裁文书，不妨碍仲裁文书发生法律效力，并可能影响其起诉权及其他权利的行使。</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"content\"\r\n

行政调解，同人民调解一样，属于诉讼外调解，所达成的协议均不具有法律上的强制执行的效力，但对当事人均应具有约束力。因为，行政调解和人民调解一样，均是在自愿的基础上所进行的调解活动，按照现有法律规定，当事人对所达成的协议，都应当自觉履行。因此，可以说行政调解所达成的协议，仍应与人民调解所达成的协议一样，对当事人具有约束力。主要常指的行政调解有这样几类：(一)基层人民政府的调解。主要调解民事纠纷和轻微刑事案件，由乡镇人民政府和街道办事处的司法助理员负责进行。(二)国家合同管理机关的调解。主要是国家工商行政管理局和地方各级工商行政管理局。法人之间和个体工商户，公民和法人之间的经济纠纷，都可以向工商行政管理机关申请调解。(三)公安机关的调解。对于因民间纠纷引起的打架斗殴或者损毁他人财物等违反治安管理的行为，情节轻微的，公安机关可以调解处理。公安机关在处理交通事故组织过程中可以组织当事人和有关人员对损害赔偿进行调解。(四)婚姻登记机关的调解。中国婚姻法规定，男、女一方提出离婚，可由有关部门进行调解或直接向人民法院提出离婚诉讼。\r\n
